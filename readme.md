# Custom .zshrc
-----

The name is STATIC so make sure you change it if you download this!  
Note that the colors will **not** look the same on your machine, they will depend on your terminal's theme!  
__Please ensure you have a [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) installed and set in your terminal, or you won't get these glyphs!__  
*Note that this usually will not display properly in WSL because of how different Windows Terminal behaves, you may need to change the brackets and remove some glyphs!*
